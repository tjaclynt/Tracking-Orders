# Tracking-Orders
This program allows the user to add multiple orders to its database that maintains its shipping status. For those who shop at many different stores and oftentimes need to be on the lookout for multiple packages, instead of having to login to each of those sites, this program will directly show you all of your packages and their status.

Provided the tracking number, the website used to obtain the package's status is: https://www.ordertracker.com/track

For orders that have recently been placed and do not yet have a tracking number, the user can input "none" and its status will be set to "In Progress." The user can then later update the item with its tracking number, and the program will automatically update the shipping status.
The list of orders are maintained by removing delivered items or any specified item upon the user's request.
